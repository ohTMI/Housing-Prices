# Project Overview
Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this projects dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.

With 81 explanatory features which describe (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this project focuses on predicting the final price of each home.

# This Project has 3 parts:
